4.1 Computational Effects
compuation may have VALUES or EFFECTS
An effect is global: it is seen by the entire computation.
An effect affects the entire compution (pun intended).
Binding is local, but variable assignment is potentially global.
model memory as a finite map: locations => values (storable values, store,
are typically, but not always, the same as the expressed values of the language)
A data structure that represents a location is called a REFERENCE (L-value).
Expressed values (R-values).
EXPLICIT REFERENCES and IMPLICIT REFERENCES

4.2 EXPLICIT-REFS: A Language with Explicit References

4.5 Parameter-Passing Variations
call-by-value (or pass-by-value): we are passing a copy of the variable to a function.
call-by-reference (or pass-by-reference): we are passing an alias of the variable to a function.
call-by-name:
call-by-need:
